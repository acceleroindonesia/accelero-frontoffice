              <p className="story-text">
                Founded in 2025 by <strong>Catherine Octaviane Tikara</strong>{" "}
                and <strong>Kevin Evannanda Septian</strong>, Accelero was born
                from personal experience. Both founders grew up in rural regions
                of Indonesia and witnessed firsthand the educational disparities
                that exist between urban and rural communities.
              </p>
              <p className="story-text">
                Their journey through education in urban centers gave them a deep
                understanding of the challenges faced by students who are often
                left behind in the classroom. Driven by this awareness and a
                commitment to change, they founded Accelero to address the urgent
                need for equitable educational opportunities for children in rural
                Indonesia.
